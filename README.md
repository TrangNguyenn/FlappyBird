# Flappy Fish
![game-banner](https://github.com/TrangNguyenn/FlappyFish/blob/main/FlappyFish.png)

I created this program while learning C++ programming using SplashKit library!

Inspired from the FlappyBird game, the ideas for Flappy Fish are generated. Same as the instructions of Flappy Bird, when players play Flappy Fish, they need to move the fish as far as possible without hitting the pipes and stop the fish from floating out of the surface.

## Usage
Download the files from Github and extract them

Open the MinGw64 or MinGw32 terminal to compile the code. For example, my file location is *C:\Users\workt\Downloads\flappy_fish*, I will type in the terminal:

```cd /c/Users/workt/Downloads/flappy_fish```

Type the compile command ```skm clang++ *.cpp -o flappyfish```

Wait for the terminal show ```ðŸŽ‰  clang++ command run successfully ðŸŽ‰``` and type ```./flappyfish``` to play the game!

Enjoy the game! :)
